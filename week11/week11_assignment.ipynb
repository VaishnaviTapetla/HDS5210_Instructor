Now, decision-makers are struggling with a number of unrelated data sources, they have to concatenate the quality metrics, financial data, and patient experience information with different time lags, low efficiency, and high error rates. This system will include automatically feeding in the information from CMS quality metrics, CDC population statistics, hospital cost reports and even patient review sites like Health Grades and Vitals, then overlay that info on top of other sources in a way that will update hourly as new data comes in.\n",

For instance, the hospital managers could easily determine the effectiveness of different quality improvement plans in relation to the return on investment, or the policy makers could have a clear picture of the role of various factors in the performance of hospitals in the undeserved areas. ED use could then also serve to underpin strategic planning, drive the discovery of facility benchmarks, guide value-based care efforts, and, in a broader sense, help enhance the delivery of care.\n"
