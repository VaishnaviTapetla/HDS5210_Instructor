        "Altogether, this assignment was fairly equally constructed – it was easy to understand theoretical concepts while at the same time requiring an application of them. The construction of the JSON structure was rather simple but defining an efficient hierarchical design was a little thought through. The coding part was a bit complex in Python – more on creating concise and informative output from nested data. I discovered the process of data tidiness not only useful but also informative during the process of raw data transformation into easily readable format. Although the assignment is not particularly complicated, it was useful in reviewing some quite basic concepts such as working with JSON and handling complex data in Python, as well as learning about practical applications. This made me think from a data storage and usage standpoint, which is something I really enjoyed doing. In general, the exercise helped me to understand the importance of structured data management and clear information sharing and became a great learning experience, which connected theory and practice."
